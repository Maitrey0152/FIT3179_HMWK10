        <h2><center>An unexpected result</center></h2>
        <p>The purpose of this visualiztion is to try and find a relationship between the wealth of a neighbourhood and the 
          type of restaurants that are available in that region. <br><br> Here we face a few serious problems when analyszing our dataset.
          A reasonable assertion to make would be that areas with higher disposale income should have more restaurants, but here 
          Melbourne (3000) which has a relatively low weekly median income but contains most of the restaurants.
          <br><br>
          This could be due to the number of restaurants tracking more closely with overall population instead of wealth. Lets dive deeper to see if we 
          can find some other insights.

      <h2><center>Organizing the dataset</center></h2>
        <p> The chart on the left allows us to see not just the number of restaurants, but also the number of seats
          they hold in total across each region.<br><br> This supports the hypothesis presented earlier with restaurant numbers tracking with overall footfall more than with income <br><br> The clear problem infront of us is that the Australian 
        beareau of statistics decided not to count Cafes and restaurants in separate categories which means that we might need to analyse this dataset differently </p>
